This project focuses on the creation of a recipe website that has a functional search engine by using js with the help of NPMs in order to make it take a total of four critereas:
1. Recipe's name.
2. Recipe's ingredients
3. Recipe's utensils
4. Recipe's appliances
<br>The algorithm for searching is dynamic but also not too slow. By using Promises, the design pattern aspect (in order to view all the corresponding recipes that the algorithm for searching returns) was proven to be more adaptive, flexible, and easier to manipulate.<br>
Some of the NPMs used also assure that the functionalities of the algorithm work on all devices/browsers regardless of the ES environment they use.
